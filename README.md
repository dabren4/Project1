This program finds available meeting times that fit a given duration based on people's busy schedules.

## How to use
The program takes in a file input.txt containing the busy schedules and meeting duration.

- Make sure Python3 is installed
- Save input data into input.txt in the format of:

```
[[busy times1], [busy times2], ...]
[working hours1 start, working hours1 end]
[[busy times1], [busy times2], ...]
[working hours2 start, working hours2 end]
meeting duration
```
- Then run the command:

```
python3 project1_starter.py
```

- Then the program will be output to a text file named output.txt
